Leon,Blade_Runner,Okay if I talk?
Holden,Blade_Runner,Don't move.
Leon,Blade_Runner,I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Holden,Blade_Runner,Don't move.
Leon,Blade_Runner,Sorry.
Leon,Blade_Runner,I already had I.Q. test this year... but I don't think I never had a...
Holden,Blade_Runner,Reaction time is a factor in this so please pay attention. Answer as quickly as you can.
Leon,Blade_Runner,Uh... sure...
Holden,Blade_Runner,One one eight seven at Hunterwasser...
Leon,Blade_Runner,Oh... that's the hotel.
Holden,Blade_Runner,What?
Leon,Blade_Runner,Where I live.
Holden,Blade_Runner,Nice place ?
Leon,Blade_Runner,Huh? Sure.  Yeah. I guess. Is that.. part of the test ?
Holden,Blade_Runner,"Warming you up, that's all."
Leon,Blade_Runner,Oh. It's
Holden,Blade_Runner,"You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when...."
Leon,Blade_Runner,Is this the test now ?
Holden,Blade_Runner,"Yes.   You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you lookdown and see a....."
Leon,Blade_Runner,What one ?
Holden,Blade_Runner,What ?
Leon,Blade_Runner,What desert ?
Holden,Blade_Runner,Doesn't make any difference what desert.. it's completely hypothetical.
Leon,Blade_Runner,But how come I'd be there?
Holden,Blade_Runner,"Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself.. who knows. So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling toward you...."
Leon,Blade_Runner,A tortoise.  What's that?
Holden,Blade_Runner,Know what a turtle is?
Leon,Blade_Runner,Of course.
Holden,Blade_Runner,Same thing.
Leon,Blade_Runner,I never seen a turtle.
Leon,Blade_Runner,But I understand what you mean.
Holden,Blade_Runner,"You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon."
Leon,Blade_Runner,"You make these questions, Mr. Holden, or they write 'em down for you?"
Holden,Blade_Runner,"The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over.  But it can't.  Not without your help.  But you're not helping."
Leon,Blade_Runner,"Whatya mean, I'm not helping?"
Holden,Blade_Runner,"I mean you're not helping!  Why is that, Leon?"
Holden,Blade_Runner,"They're just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down for me.  It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response."
Holden,Blade_Runner,Shall we continue?
Holden,Blade_Runner,Describe in single words.  Only the good things that come into your mind.  About your mother.
Leon,Blade_Runner,My...
Geneticist,Gattaca,"You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity"
Mary,Gattaca,"We didn't want diseases, yes."
Tom,Gattaca,We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
Geneticist,Gattaca,"You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the best of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result."
Tom,Gattaca,"He's right, Mary.  That's right."
Geneticist,Gattaca,Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Tom,Gattaca,"Er, no..."
Geneticist,Gattaca,"Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage."
Tom,Gattaca,I like football.
Geneticist,Gattaca,"I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time."
Geneticist,Gattaca,Anything I've forgotten?
Mary,Gattaca,We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
Geneticist,Gattaca,I understand.  That's already been taken care of. Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Mary,Gattaca,"Tom, the choir..."
Geneticist,Gattaca,I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
Tom,Gattaca,How much extra?
Geneticist,Gattaca,It would be five thousand more.
Tom,Gattaca,"I'm sorry, there's no way we can."
Geneticist,Gattaca,Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb. We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
Mary,Gattaca,What will happen to the others?
Geneticist,Gattaca,"They are not babies, Mary, merely ""human possibilities""."
Geneticist,Gattaca,Smaller than a grain of sand.
